# Moringa-Data-Science-Core-IP-WK-7
Introduction
HassConsult offers investment-grade developments all over the City. The developments offered have been conceptualized by our development team to be high quality assets using a data-driven approach in planning and design, that gears property for high rental returns and an escalated rate of capital growth.

The Hass Index is Kenya’s first ever published property price index with over 17 years of historical data of Kenya’s property markets. It has proven over the last decade to be an important tool providing investors, home owners, the financial industry and consumers with current and historical information about house price inflation- allowing them to make informed decisions in the housing market, in order to enjoy the best possible returns.

Research Question
Studying the factors that affect housing prices using the information given here on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months and later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables
